#### Step 2: Upload Your Latest Health Report
Upload your most recent health report, which is analysed to assess your vitals and create a customised gym plan that suits your fitness goals.

#### Step 3: Data Processing & Prompt Engineering
We apply advanced prompt engineering to process the scraped data and format the exercises in a user-friendly list. Each exercise comes with a YouTube video link to guide you through proper execution.
